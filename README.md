# Search Engine Simulation for Story Book

This project helped me gain experience processing text files, building indexes using Python dictionaries, and using regular expressions.

I built an index of words in a collection of short stories and then provide an interface to allow users to conduct short Boolean text queries to find stories that match their search. I indexed the Project Gutenberg text of Grimmsâ€™ Fairy Tales, by The Brothers Grimm.
